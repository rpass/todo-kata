# Todo Kata

A [code kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) designed to hone your web app building skills.

Set a time limit (1hr) and try to meet all the criteria below in that time.
After you stop, reflect on:
* where were you slower than you would have liked (unfamiliar tools, using the mouse, looking things up)
* which design choices made earlier on made change difficult later on
* is your code something to be proud of
* if you finished the criteria below before your time limit, could you do it faster?

Finally, set yourself an improvement focus which will get you toward your goal: mastery.

## Criteria

Build a todo app that allows a user to
* create, read, update, delete and complete a todo item from their list
* delete all items from their list
* re/name their list without a full page reload
* start a new list and navigate between the two

---
Stretch goals
* authentication: username and password
* authorization: user can only interact with their own lists
* tagging: user can be tagged by their email on an item and it appears in their list
